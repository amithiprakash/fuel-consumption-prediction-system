# Metadata:
---    
1. Dataset  : Given dataset contain 2022 Fuel Consumption Ratings information.

2. Model Year: Represent the year in which a particular model of a vehicle was produced. 

3. Make: It describe the brand or manufacturer of a vehicle.

4. Model: It refers to a specific version of a vehicle produced by a manufacturer under a particular make or brand.
5. Vehicle Class: Represent the categorization system used in the automotive industry to group vehicles based on their size, body style, and intended use. 

6. Engine Size: It tell us about the total volume of air and fuel that can be drawn into the engine cylinders of a vehicle's engine during one complete cycle. It is typically measured in either cubic centimeters (cc)                      or liters (L).

7. Cylinders: It refer to the individual chambers within a vehicle's engine where the combustion process takes place.

8. Transmission: It represent the system in which power transmission take place, from the engine to the wheels, which allowing the vehicle to move forward or backward

9. Fuel Type: It refers to the specific type of fuel that is used to power a vehicle, machine, or other device. Z=  Premium gasoline | D=  Diesel | E=  Ethanol  |  X=Regular gasoline
                   
10. Fuel Consumption(City (L/100 km): it represent fuel consumption in the city.

11. Fuel Consumption(Hwy (L/100 km): it represent fuel consumption on the Highway.

12. Fuel Consumption(Comb (L/100 km): it represent fuel consumption for both city and highway.

13. Fuel Consumption(Comb (mpg)): it represent fuel consumption for both city & highway, in miles per imperial gallon(mpg).

14. CO2 Emissions(g/km): It refer to the amount of CO2 that is emitted by a vehicle for every kilometer that it is driven.

15. CO2 Rating: It's measure a vehicle's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, typically expressed in grams of CO2 per kilometer(g/km).
16. Smog Rating: It's measure a vehicle's emissions of pollutants that contribute to the formation of smog.
