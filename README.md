# Fuel Consumption Prediction System
This project focuses on predicting fuel consumption using machine learning techniques and deploying the trained model using a Flask backend. It demonstrates an end-to-end implementation of a machine learning project.

## Project Overview
Fuel consumption prediction helps in analyzing vehicle efficiency and energy usage.  
In this project, a machine learning model is trained on fuel consumption data and then integrated with a Flask-based backend to provide predictions.

## Project Structure
- CODE  
  Contains data preprocessing, machine learning model training, and saved model files.
- CODE_flask  
  Contains the Flask backend application used to load the trained model and generate predictions.

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- Machine Learning  
- Flask  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  

## How the System Works
1. Data is collected and preprocessed.
2. A machine learning model is trained to predict fuel consumption.
3. The trained model is saved.
4. Flask backend loads the saved model.
5. User inputs are passed to the backend.
6. The system returns predicted fuel consumption.

## How to Run the Project
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Install required Python libraries.
3. Run the Flask application.
4. Provide input values to get fuel consumption prediction.

## Output
The system predicts fuel consumption values based on the given input parameters.
